#project title: task1(dictionary student marks)
                task2(list slicing)

#project description: task1: in this task it requested to make a dictionary of students with their class marks in it, then it required us to make a code to insert the students name in it and it will give you the marks of the student, but if you insert a student's name that isn't within the dictionary it will say: 'student not found'.
                      task2: in this task it requested to make a list of numbers from 1 to 10, then asked to print out the list itself, and then print out the first five numbers from the list, after that it wants the same first five numbers and print it reversed.

#how to use the project: task1: the way to use the project is first run the code, then type the name of the student, like: Alice. and it should print out Alice`s marks.
                         task2: the only thing you need to do is run the project and it will do the rest by printing out the list from 1 to 10, then print the first five numbers, then reverse the first five numbers.
                                                                        thank you, see you next time.
                                                                                    :)
